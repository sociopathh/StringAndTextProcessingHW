//Task 08: Write a program that extracts from a given text all sentences containing given word.
//Example: The word is "in". The text is: "We are living in a yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. Inside the submarine is very tight.
//So we are drinking all the day. We will move out of it in 5 days."
//The expected result is: "We are living in a yellow submarine. We will move out of it in 5 days."
//Consider that the sentences are separated by "." and the words – by non-letter symbols.
